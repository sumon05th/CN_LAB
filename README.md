                ## Computer Networks Lab Experiments List
                
1. Write a Client-Server socket program in C to implement “TCP
client-server” architecture. Description: retrieve information (any text or
system info) from TCP server to TCP client./

2. Write a Client-Server socket program in C to implement “TCP chat
server.” Description: two client systems are connected to one central
server for connection establishment. Communication/chat have to be done
in client machines./

3. Write a socket program to implement Go-Back-N Protocol using TCP.
(little high level, so we can ask for any other protocol implementation)./

4. Write an Echo Client and Echo server using UDP to estimate the round
trip Time from the client to the server. The server should be such that it
can accept Multiple connections at any given time./

5. Write a program for connectionless iterative service in which the server
finds the factorial of a number sent by the client and sends it back./

6. Write a Client-Server socket program in C to implement “FTP server”
using a TCP connection. Description: file.txt may be there on the server
side with some text. On client request server have to send text saved
file.txt, and the corresponding text has to print on the client terminal./

7. Program for Remote Command Execution using sockets.
Explanation. The client sends command and data parameters (if required)
to the server. The server will execute the command and send back the
result to the client./

8. Write a program to implement a Web Server. (Problem Definition: The
Client will request a web page to be accessed which resides on the Server
side.)
